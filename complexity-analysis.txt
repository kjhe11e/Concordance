Complexity analysis of the Concordance application:

Time complexity (worst-case) = O(n^2) due to use of C standard library's qsort
function. However, this is only in rare cases such as when the concordance is passed
in descending order (which would be highly unlikely for this particular application,
unless the input file was already organized in reverse-alphabetical order).
For general use cases, for example when the input is an eBook, the average-case
time complexity is O(nlog(n)), where 'n' is the size of the concordance list.

Space complexity = O(2n + log(n)) since we store the words as a linked-list
which is O(n) space, we convert the linked-list to an array for sorting which also
requires O(n) space, and we leverage C standard library's qsort method which requires
log(n) space. Therefore our space complexity is O(2n), where 'n' is the size
of the concordance.
