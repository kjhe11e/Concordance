Complexity analysis of the Concordance application:

Time complexity (worst-case) = O(n * m), where 'n' is the size of the input
and 'm' is the average word length. This is due to the 'findWord' method iterating
through the concordance linked-list (O(n)) and, in the worst-case, comparing
char* word values for each node in the linked-list (which is O(m) since we compare
character by character). Thus we have O(n * m).

Space complexity (worst-case) = O(n) since we store the words as a linked-list,
which is O(n), and we convert the linked-list to an array for sorting, which also
requires O(n) space.
