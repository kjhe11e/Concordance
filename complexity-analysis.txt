Complexity analysis of the Concordance application:

Time complexity (worst-case) = O(n^2) due to use of C standard library's qsort
function. However, this is only in rare cases such as when the concordance is passed
in descending order. In general use, the average case time complexity is O(nlog(n)),
where 'n' is the size of the concordance list.

Space complexity (worst-case) = O(n) since we store the words as a linked-list,
which is O(n), and we convert the linked-list to an array for sorting, which also
requires O(n) space.
